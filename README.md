# SmartPreloader
Simple JS plugin which will preload links to speed up the UX.

This plugin will preload URLs behind links. By default all links will be preloaded on mouseover, but you may also pass a distance (perimeter).

The URL will be preloaded in JS, before your user will click the link. This will help to speedup the page and create a better UX.

Yes, it may happen that users will not click the links they hovered or passed, but that's life.

Take a look at the index.html so see how this plugin works.
